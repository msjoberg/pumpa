# Official packages

Pumpa is packaged in [Debian](https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=pumpa) and [Ubuntu](http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=pumpa&searchon=names), so if you are using
one of those, you can simply install it with your favourite package
manager or by typing (as root or using `sudo`):

    apt-get install pumpa

# Third party packages

In addition, some third parties have provided packages or installers
for other platforms listed below. Please note, that I have no control
over these, so please report any problems with them to the respective
packagers/authors.  Alternatively you can download the source code and
compile it yourself, it's pretty easy, [[see instructions below|install#Compiling_yourself]].

# Compiling yourself

## Build dependencies
  
Pumpa should build with Qt 4.8 or Qt 5.0 or newer. If you are using Qt
4, you will also need the [QJson library][6].

For example on Debian 7.0 "wheezy" the following command should
install everything needed to build the code:

    aptitude install build-essential qt4-qmake libqt4-dev libqjson-dev libtidy-dev

If you want spell checking install the aspell library as well:

    aptitude install libaspell-dev

On Fedora I believe this should install what you need:

    yum install gcc-c++ qt-devel qt-config qjson-devel libtidy-devel libaspell-devel

[6]: http://qjson.sourceforge.net/

## Building

To download and build, type the following in your directory of choice:

    git clone git://pumpa.branchable.com/
    cd pumpa
    qmake-qt4     # or just "qmake" on some systems
    make

The procedure on Mac OS X is the same, but getting the dependencies is
a bit different, see the [HowTo for building Pumpa on OS X](https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/wiki/HowTo-for-building-Pumpa-on-OS-X) by [habi@fmrl.me](http://fmrl.me/habi).

Even though it isn't recommended, if you have problems with the libtidy dependency it is possible to compile Pumpa without it by running qmake as `qmake CONFIG+=notidy`. This will also disable the use of raw HTML, however Markdown syntax will still work.
