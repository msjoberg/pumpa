Pumpa is packaged in [Debian jessie and
sid](https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=pumpa) and [Ubuntu
trusty](http://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/pumpa), so if you are using
one of those, you can simply install it with your favourite package
manager or by typing (as root or using `sudo`):

    apt-get install pumpa

In addition, some third parties have provided packages or installers
for other platforms listed below. Please note, that I have no control
over these, so please report any problems with them to the respective
packagers/authors.  Alternatively you can download the source code and
compile it yourself, it's pretty easy (see the following sections).

## Build dependencies
  
Pumpa should build with Qt 4.8 or Qt 5.0 or newer. If you are using Qt
4, you will also need the [QJson library][6].

For example on Debian 7.0 "wheezy" the following command should
install everything needed to build the code:

    aptitude install qt4-qmake libqt4-dev libqjson-dev libtidy-dev

If you want spell checking install the aspell library as well:

    aptitude install libaspell-dev

On Fedora this should install what you need (courtesy of [Dick Turpin][10]):

    yum install gcc-c++ qt-devel qt-config qjson-devel libtidy-devel

## Building

To download and build, type the following:

    git clone git://gitorious.org/pumpa/pumpa.git
    cd pumpa
    qmake-qt4     # or just "qmake" on some systems
    make

The procedure on Mac OS X is the same, but getting the dependencies is
a bit different, David Haberth&uuml;r has made a detailed guide for
building on Mac OS X here:
<https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/wiki/HowTo-for-building-Pumpa-on-OS-X>

Axel has a blog post about compiling for Windows here: <https://axel668.wordpress.com/2013/07/18/how-to-build-pumpa-qt-based-pump-io-client-for-windows/>
