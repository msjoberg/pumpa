# Official packages

Pumpa is packaged in [Debian](https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=pumpa) and [Ubuntu](http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=pumpa&searchon=names), so if you are using
one of those, you can simply install it with your favourite package
manager or by typing (as root or using `sudo`):

    apt-get install pumpa


# Third party packages

In addition, some third parties have provided packages or installers
for other platforms listed below. Please note, that I have no control
over these, so please report any problems with them to the respective
packagers/authors.  Alternatively you can download the source code and
compile it yourself, it's pretty easy, [[see instructions below|install#Compiling_yourself]].

# Compiling yourself

## Build dependencies
  
Pumpa should build with Qt 4.8 or Qt 5.0 or newer. If you are using Qt
4, you will also need the [QJson library][6].

For example on Debian 8 "jessie" the following command should install
everything needed to build the code:

    aptitude install build-essential qt5-qmake qtbase5-dev libtidy-dev

If you want spell checking install the aspell library as well:

    aptitude install libaspell-dev

Building with Qt 4.8 on Debian Jessie - this way building with Qt 4.8 makes Pumpa use your choice of theme i.e oxygen so it fits in better with the desktop. 

    aptitude install build-essential qt4-qmake qt4-default libtidy-dev libqjson-dev libaspell-dev 

On Fedora I believe this should install what you need:

    yum install gcc-c++ qt-devel qt-config qjson-devel libtidy-devel libaspell-devel

## Building

To download and build, type the following in your directory of choice:

    git clone git://pumpa.branchable.com/ pumpa
    cd pumpa
    qmake     # or qmake-qt4 or qmake-qt5 in some systems
    make

If you do not wish to use the development version from git, you can also download the most recent release tarballs from <http://saz.im/software/downloads/pumpa/>.

On Mac OS X (Version 10.10.3) the procedures is similar; getting the dependencies and setting the build environment is different. (These notes are derived from [HowTo for building Pumpa on OS X](https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/wiki/HowTo-for-building-Pumpa-on-OS-X) by [habi@fmrl.me](http://fmrl.me/habi).)

[Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/) can be used to install Pumpa dependencies:

	brew install qt qjson aspell

To download and build pumpa, type the following in your directory of choice:

    export LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
    export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/local/include
    git clone git://pumpa.branchable.com/ pumpa
    cd pumpa
    qmake
    make
    open .

You should now have a pumpa.app object (directory) in the build directory.
Move pumpa.app to ~/Applications (or /Applications)
