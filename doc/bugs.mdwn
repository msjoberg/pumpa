This is Pumpa's bug tracker. Please report any bugs or feature
requests here. If there's something preventing you from reporting a
bug here you can email me at <mats@sjoberg.fi>.

Also check bugs filed against
[Pumpa in Debian](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?package=pumpa).

Common tags for bugs reports: [[high]] [[feature]] [[waiting]] [[resolved]].  
(The tag "waiting" just means it's waiting for something, e.g. a upstream update, this is mostly information for the maintainer.)
