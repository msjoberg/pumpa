An early announcement was made that Qt4 is going to be removed from 
Stretch, otherwise known as Jessie + 1.  pumpa is currently based on 
Qt4.  While it is not necessary or appropriate to break Jessie's current 
freeze to switch to Qt5 it is necessary to begin re-factoring code to 
prepare for this coming switch.  The full early announcement can be read
