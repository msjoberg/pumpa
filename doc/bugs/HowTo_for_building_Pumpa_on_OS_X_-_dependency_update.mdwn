I followed these OSX instructions on a new iMac (OSX 10.10.1) (https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/wiki/HowTo-for-building-Pumpa-on-OS-X))

and encountered the following build error:

    In file included from src/main.cpp:25:
    In file included from src/pumpapp.h:52:
    In file included from src/messagewindow.h:35:
    In file included from src/messageedit.h:29:
    src/qaspell.h:32:10: fatal error: 'aspell.h' file not found
    #include <aspell.h>
                       ^
    1 error generated.
    make: *** [obj/main.o] Error 1

homebrew installs aspell.h into /usr/local/include.

I edited the pumpa Makefile and added

    -I/usr/local/include


to the "INCPATH" and executed a successful build.

Perhaps adding /usr/local/include to the pumpa Makefile INCPATH a good enough solution.
