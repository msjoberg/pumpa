You are right. I checked tidy versions and found a breaking change between Debian (20091223) and OS X (20061031, very old) versions.
An affected parameter TidyBodyOnly changed its type to integer on Debian. Unfortunately libtidy does not provide version numbers so it was needed to parse a release date to distinguish these versions. So the following patch solves an error on Debian by choosing a needed type automatically at runtime.

Please check the [patch](https://gist.github.com/theirix/d7a9472db48bcc81a6b8).
