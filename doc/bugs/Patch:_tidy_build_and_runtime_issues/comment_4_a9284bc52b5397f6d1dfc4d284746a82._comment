I added the patch, but this change doesn't go over well with the libtidy in Debian jessie (stable):

    -    tidyOptSetInt(tdoc, TidyBodyOnly, yes) &&
    +    tidyOptSetBool(tdoc, TidyBodyOnly, yes) &&

It crashes on this error:

    pumpa: config.c:397: prvTidySetOptionBool: Assertion `option_defs[ optId ].type == TidyBoolean' failed.
    Aborted

I suspect it's a problem due to different versions of the library.  Do you have any suggestion? Is adding an #ifdef the only solution?
