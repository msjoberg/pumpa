I posted a note, and entered this line of code:

    r1 = 1%1 + 1%10000000

Markdown was enabled. Preview was enabled, and displayed:

    r1 = 1%1 + 1%10000000

Once posted, the note displayed as:

    r1 = 1%1 + 1000000

This happened both when the code was indented as code, and when it was pasted as-is without any indentation.
