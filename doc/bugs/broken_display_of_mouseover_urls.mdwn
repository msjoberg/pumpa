Expected behavior: I move the mouse over an link in pumpa,
and the full url is displayed at the bottom of the window.

Actual behavior: Works sometimes but other times the displayed url is
not the one the mouse is over.

Analysis: There are two kinds of links; links inside posts and links that
pumpa makes to eg, people's names. If I first mouse over someone's name,
and then move the mouse to be over a link inside a post, this is when
pumpa keeps displaying the old url, rather than showing the new url I
moved the mouse over.

Certain mouse movements clear the previously displayed url, and then
the problem doesn't happen.
