Hmm, strange what about using `CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH` instead? :-)

The thing is I'd rather not add include paths for every possibility. If you compile something in an environment it should already be configured so that the C++ compiler will find the headers needed. It shouldn't be the responsibility of each application to do that. 

Sorry for being difficult :-)
