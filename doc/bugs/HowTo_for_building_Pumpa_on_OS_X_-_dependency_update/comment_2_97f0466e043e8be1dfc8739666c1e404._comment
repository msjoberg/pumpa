Sazius, I just tried rebuilding with C_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/local/include in the environment and had the same error:

    src/qaspell.h:32:10: fatal error: 'aspell.h' file not found
    #include <aspell.h>
                  ^
    1 error generated.
    make: *** [obj/main.o] Error 1

Maybe include C_INCLUDE_PATH in INCPATH in Makefile?
