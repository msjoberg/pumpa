First, you are not being difficult. Less code == less maintenance.

Second, thanks for the suggestion; CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH worked. I have been away from C/C++ programming for some time.

I will work on getting the pump.io/wiki page updated to include specifying this environment variable.

Thanks, and have a great new year.
