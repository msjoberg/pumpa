If I have a note I'm trying to post, and the current wifi network is a
typical horrible gatewayed public wifi network, the post may fail a
couple of times. I'll then go do something else. In the meantime, pumpa
will try to refresh the timeline. Then pumpa will complain that it got a
bad ssl cert. Then it will exit. This causes the words I was trying to
post to get lost.

I suggest pumpa not exit in this situation, but instead just fail
whatever network operation is being blocked by the MITM.

(Not filing at grave bug severity because meh, it's just words. How
important can words be? ...)
