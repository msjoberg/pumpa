jrobb: Would it be possible to highlight certain strings in posts?
for instance, I could add "jrobb" to my highlight list, and this would be highlighted in posts where mentioned (like IRC).

Also, maybe if this happens in the "meanwhile" tab the header could get a "*" or different highlight color instead of red.
