David Marsden: Tab for user timeline, i.e., when you click on a user's name it shows their timeline in a new tab (a bit like Heybuddy does). Useful for deciding wheter to follow someone. I think current behaviour opens up a web page instead.

Sazius: 
This is definitely on my todo list, but I need to first make tabs that can be closed. The Qt toolkit that I'm using makes that a bit difficult, I need to investigate this.
