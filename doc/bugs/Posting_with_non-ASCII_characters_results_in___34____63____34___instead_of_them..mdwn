There was a nasty bug in Pumpa v0.8.4 which caused basically any special characters to be messed up (I think those that aren't in latin1 or in different places in UTF8). Ironically I didn't notice this even though my last name contains such a character :-) It's fixed now in git master, and a new release is coming within ~1 week.
