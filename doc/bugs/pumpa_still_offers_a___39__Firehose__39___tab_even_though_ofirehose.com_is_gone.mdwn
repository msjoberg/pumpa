pumpa still presents a link to a "Firehose" tab even though 
ofirehose.com is gone.  This is a minor issue as the rest of the package 
works.  Within the pump.io network we've been de-emphasizing people 
directly accessing the firehose.  Removal of the tab would be a nice 
safety measure to avoid presenting errors to users as time goes by.
