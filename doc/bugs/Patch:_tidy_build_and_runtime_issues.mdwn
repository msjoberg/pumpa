Hello,

Please review my patch. Branchable does not accept patches so I stored it in [the gist](https://gist.github.com/theirix/926b7ffcc99eb01174e0).

It fixes build error by replacing explicit TidyBuffer init with proper function call. Also it prevents a runtime error at tidyOptSetInt.

I successfully compiled and used tidy-enabled Pumpa with this patch.
