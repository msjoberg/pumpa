bernhard: Does it make sense to run pumpa in some profiling tool like valgrind or compiled with -g1 -g3, it may provide some insights
if memory or cyclers are lost. Iâ€™ve noticed some issues when running pumpa for several hours and loaded a lot of of lot messages.
(I usually do not run pumpa longer than 8 hours and then shut down my workspace machine.)

Running it even longer with profiling or memory checking could give some ideas where to debug further.

sazius: I ran with valgrind and found the FileDownloader to be a big problem. I think the situation is now improved after a rewrite to FileDownloader, however it is still not good.
