Thanks for the bug report! In fact the problem is not that Pumpa encodes the ampersands in the URL as \&amp; - in fact this is the correct behaviour. The problem was that Pumpa did not decode them when rendering the post. This should now be [fixed in this commit](http://source.pumpa.branchable.com/?p=source.git;a=commit;h=28b3b6c4f7840895d18c3891c3b2f9974ea553e5).
