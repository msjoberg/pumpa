Most features and configuration options should be obvious from the
graphical user interface, but some are a bit hidden.  For example,
while Pumpa doesn't support multiple accounts, you can always start it
with a different configuration file (which can specify another pump.io
account for example) like this:

    ./pumpa -c path_to_alternative.conf

If you are setting up a new account you can give the path to a
non-existent conf-file and Pumpa will run the setup wizard and create
the conf-file for you with the name you specified.

The location of the default configuration file depends on Qt, which
[tries to pick a location that makes sense for your operating system][12].
E.g. in GNU/Linux systems it is typically in:

    ~/.config/pumpa/pumpa.conf

Most configuration options are exposed via the preferences dialog in
Pumpa, except for setting the link colour.  The link colour is
supposed to be automatically set by the theme settings of your desktop
environment, but several people requested a way to override this.

You can add a line like this under the `[%General]` section in the
configuration file:

    link_color=#333

The text after the equals sign can be
[any text string that Qt can parse as a colour][11]. (Yes I know
colour is spelt wrong in the config name :-)
