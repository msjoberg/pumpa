If you experience crashes it may be useful to run Pumpa in debug
mode.  Right now you'll need to recompile it for that with the
following steps:

    cd pumpa
    make clean
    qmake CONFIG+=debug
    make
    
In addition to adding debugger support to the executable, using debug mode will also cause Pumpa
to display a lot more output to the terminal (stdout), e.g. when it is making HTTP requests, 
and other information potentially useful when debugging.

To run Pumpa in the debugger (you need to have `gdb` installed) type:

    gdb ./pumpa

Inside gdb you then start Pumpa with the command `run`. If it has
crashed you'll be thrown back to the debugger, then type `where`,
which will tell you where it crashed. This information can be very
useful (in particular the first 10-20 lines), please include it if you
report a bug.
