If you experience crashes it may be useful to run Pumpa in debug
mode.  Right now you'll need to recompile it for that with the
following steps:

    cd pumpa
    make clean
    qmake CONFIG+=debug
    make
    
To run in the debugger (you need to have `gdb` installed):

    gdb ./pumpa

Inside gdb you then start Pumpa with the command `run`, when it has
crashed you'll be thrown back to the debugger, then type `where`,
which will tell you where it crashed. This information can be very
useful (in particular the first 10-20 lines), please include it if you
report a bug.
