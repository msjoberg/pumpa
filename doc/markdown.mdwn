When you are posting a new note or comment you can use [Markdown
syntax][7]. Since Pumpa version v0.8.4 inline HTML is also allowed as
in standard Markdown.

For example:

- \*stars\* make the word emphasised, typically *italics*
- \*\*double stars\*\*  strong emphasis, typically **bold**
- surround links with < and > like so: &lt;http://example.com/&gt;
- link text \[like this\]\(http://example.com/\)
- a hash (#) at the start of the line makes an H1 heading, so be
  careful with hash tags :-)

Enable the Preview below the text editing window to see what the
output will be before posting it to pump.io.

For the [full Markdown syntax see John Gruber's page][7].
