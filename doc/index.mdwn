Pumpa is a simple [pump.io](http://pump.io) client written in C++ and
Qt. Pumpa is [[Free_Software|license]].

"Pumpa" is a Swedish word that means either "to pump" (as a verb) or
"pumpkin" (as a noun) :-)

Pumpa was mentioned on [LWN: "Searching for a pump.io
client"](https://lwn.net/Articles/575691/).

Pumpa running under Gnome 3 even though it's a Qt application:

## Running

On Linux you can start pumpa by running its binary:

    ./pumpa

On Mac OS X a regular clickable application file (pumpa.app) should be
created.

At first launch an OAuth wizard will pop-up, just enter your pump.io
account id, and click Next. Then a the authentication page with your
pump.io server will be opened in the web browser, just follow the
instructions there. Finally a pair of codes (token, verifier) will
appear that you need to copy & paste back into pumpa.

## Markdown

When you are posting a new note or comment you can use [Markdown
syntax][7]. Since Pumpa version v0.8.4 inline HTML is also allowed as
in standard Markdown.

For example:

- \*stars\* make the word emphasised, typically *italics*
- \*\*double stars\*\*  strong emphasis, typically **bold**
- surround links with < and > like so: &lt;http://example.com/&gt;
- link text \[like this\]\(http://example.com/\)
- a hash (#) at the start of the line makes an H1 heading, so be
  careful with hash tags :-)

Enable the Preview below the text editing window to see what the
output will be before posting it to pump.io.

For the [full Markdown syntax see John Gruber's page][7].
